<p>This simplistic webpage was created by GitHub's own automatic page generator (and my content of course). The content was then modified by my team consisting of me, myself, and I. We worked for many hours (acctually, minutes...) to bring this page up to working standards. Now, it is a fully functional website hosted from github.io with my account.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lack of Content</h3>

<p>I don't really have a lot of content at the moment, but feel free to check out the links at the top of the page to see some stuff I find intresting. As i find more stuff thats worth putting up there, I will replace them.</p>
