<p>The internet is almost certainly the larges collection of public information ever created. The best part is, all this knowlege is available at your fingertips. Anyone with a wifi enabled device has
   access to almost limitless knowlege. And like any structured database, there are parts that are indexed and easily found. Other parts, however, are unknown to major search engines or are inacessable
    through standard web browsers. These inaccessable parts of the internet are collectavely known as the Dark Web. This shouldnt be confused with the term Deep Web, meaning any part of the Dark Web that
     requires specialize software to access. Since this page is a documentation of the Deep Web, I wont go into detail about the technical consept of the Dark Web. Instead, lets get down to buisness.</p>

 <a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tor and the Deep Web</h3>

 <p>As I meantioned earlier, the Deep Web is accessable be special software. A popular way to connect to the Deep Web is through The Onion Router, or TOR for short. The main reason
    TOR is so popular is it offers almost complete anonymity for the user by bouncing their IP address off several nodes and encrypting your web traffic. This effectively masks the
  user's identity making it difficult to track their internet traffic back to any indevidual computer. This makes it the safest browser to connect to the Deep Web. To sum TOR up in
   a sentence, its the perfect browser to desguise yourself on the internet while providing access to special websites that end in the .onion extension. TOR is relatively easy to
    setup and configure, so I'll just link to their website <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">here</a>. Alternatively, I will provide direct download links below:</p>
